Where applicable, additional data purposes related to individual services are described in Section 9.

The legal basis of collecting your information through the use of cookies is the legal basis of IDRISS of optimizing its website pursuant to Article 6, 1(f) GDPR.

5\. Period for which the personal data will be stored

IDRISS stores your personal data for a reasonable period of time and never for longer than it is absolutely necessary.

6\. Disclosure and transfer of personal data

By using the Site and sending information and/or your personal data to IDRISS you acknowledge that part of your personal information may be processed in the United States. The UE Commission has recently issued an adequacy decision in relation to the USA but IDRISS is not a member of the privacy shield and, therefore, data will be transferred to the USA on the basis of the consent of data subject or if the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request to pursuant to Article 49, 1, (A) or (B) of GDPR. By communicating your personal data to IDRISS you hereby fully and irrevocably agree that part of your data may be transfered to the USA.&#x20;

* Agents, businesses, or service providers who process your personal information for providing the Services to you. The respective receiving third parties shall observe and adhere to strict confidentiality agreements. We are committed to maximum protection of your personal information, therefore, we only deal with ethical suppliers and business partners who demonstrate similar values and are bound by privacy laws of the same standard.
* Law enforcement agencies and/or other public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency) when required to do so by law.

7\. Cookie policy

We are using cookies to improve the quality of the client’s experience on the Site. The cookie, a small text file that is stored on the customer’s computer for record-keeping purposes, can be used as an identification card: a cookie is unique to your computer and only the server that gave it to you can read them. Using traffic log cookies, we can identify and monitor what pages are mostly used. This will help us to analyze data about website traffic and later improve our website. Most existing web browsers can automatically receive cookies, but you can change your browser settings and decide whether to accept cookies or not. There is one important characteristic – cookies do not provide websites with personal information (such as email addresses or other information) without your permission. Once you provide a website with personal information, your information can be linked to the data stored in the cookie. You should remember that we will not share your personal information with third parties if we do not have permission from you or if we are not required to do it by law. Our main goal is to make our website as efficient for you as we can. We can personalize your web experience on our website with cookies: we will remember you as an individual and what content was interesting for you, and as a result, we can remove web pages that are not important and offer you the most popular products and services based on your web preferences (for example we may send you promotional emails with information about our new products, new special offers, special deals, etc.).

* The right to object – you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data.
* The right to restrict processing – you have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data by the controller or the processor at any time and free of charge.

We will inform you of any extension within one month of receiving the notice, stating the reasons for the extension.&#x20;

IDRISS will provide the necessary information in relation to the notice only if the sender has been properly identified. IDRISS is not obliged to respond to a notice in the event that it is unable to identify the data subject or his/her credentials. We may request the provision of additional information and documents necessary to confirm the identity and authority of the data subject when there are reasonable concerns.
