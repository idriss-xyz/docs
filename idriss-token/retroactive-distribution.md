**IDRISS User**

_You have registered an IDRISS account or used the browser extension_

* **Account registration**
  * **Paid account**: users who registered an account and paid the $10 registration fee. This was the only paid feature for a long time and contributed significantly to where IDRISS is today. This criteria carries x10 weight compared to a free account or extension use, recognizing the early users who bought the product and supported the platform financially.
  * **Free account**: users who joined for free via allowlisting, campaigns, or giveaways.&#x20;
* **Extension**: Users who made transfers on 2 unique days using the browser extension on any mainnet network. No minimum amount required, and any recipient is allowed.
* **Early User Multiplier**: increases the longer you've been registered. It’s calculated by dividing the number of days since your registration by the total number of days since the launch in 2022, then adding 1 to the ratio to get your multiplier. The longer you've been registered, the higher your multiplier.
* **Referral multiplier:** increases based on the number of people you invite. To calculate your multiplier, we took the cubic root of the sum of your invites plus 1. For example, if you invited 7 people, your multiplier was 2. The more people you invited, the higher your multiplier, but the rate of increase slows down as the number of invites grows.

**Gitcoin Donor**

_You donated a total of $20 to any project in open source rounds between GR15 (September 2022) and GG20 (Aprill 2024)_

IDRISS is proudly self-funded with support from grants, and Gitcoin has been our biggest source of funding. Donors like you choose to support public goods, helping to create positive outcomes that encourage innovation in open-source projects.

**Sale Participant**

_You purchased IDRISS within the first 12 hours of the sale and held it for 3 weeks (12:00pm UTC, January 27, 2025)_

By participating in the sale, you helped bootstrap liquidity for IDRISS DA&#x4F;**.** Holding your tokens for 3 weeks signals that you're likely to be a long-term holder, supporting the DAO’s growth.

**Partner Member**

_You are a highly engaged member of a partner community_

These excellent projects and communities are key partners, providing the infrastructure we use, being part of our products, or influencing what we build by having their communities actively engage with our products. We see them as key players in the future of IDRISS, and we are committed to continuing to build for these communities and on their infrastructure.

#### Claiming Plans

* **Early Claim** gives you instant access to 50% of your tokens, but you forego the remaining 50% for immediate access. You can lock your tokens in the vault to receive benefits.
* **Full Claim** unlocks your tokens in the vault on July 6, 2025, but you’ll immediately benefit from 12% APR, premium token-gated features, and access to revenue sharing. If you don’t meet the 10,000 token threshold required for premium, you can buy more tokens on the market to reach it, and we’ll consider the total amount.

#### Vault

The Vault is a mechanism allowing you to lock IDRISS tokens to earn rewards. Tokens can be locked and unlocked at any time, with only gas costs required. Tokens give benefits only while they are locked, with no unbonding period.

* Earn 12% APR on locked tokens
* Lock 10,000 $IDRISS or more to access premium features
* Tap into decentralized revenue sharing from IDRISS apps (launching in Q2 2025)
