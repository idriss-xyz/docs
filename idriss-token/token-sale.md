# Token sale

IDRISS is a proudly self-funded project. Instead of the typical reliance on venture capital to provide liquidity, we are crowdsourcing it directly from the community. Bootstrapping liquidity from a large group of people who believe in the project creates a community-driven foundation for the token.

#### Sale details

* For sale: 5% of the total token supply
* FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation): $30M
* Price per token: $0.03
* Dates: 12:00 PM UTC, January 6, 2025 â€“ 11:59 PM UTC, January 10, 2025
* Cap: the sale ends early once 5% of the total token supply is sold

#### Sale mechanism

The sale works similarly to a fixed-price sale. We use a single-sided liquidity mechanism based on Uniswap v3, where only IDRISS tokens are added to the liquidity pool, and buyers pay in USDC. The liquidity range will be set minimally around 0.03 USDC/IDRISS, creating a price floor and ensuring price stability throughout the sale.

During the sale, IDRISS DAO will actively manage the liquidity. Once certain milestones are reached, liquidity will be withdrawn to create a full-range UniV3 IDRISS/ETH pool, ensuring uninterrupted trading. The IDRISS token portion of the withdrawn liquidity will be returned to the single-sided liquidity pool, which will remain minimally set around 0.03 USDC/IDRISS.

#### Post-sale

The entire 100% of the USDC proceeds will be swapped for ETH and added to a full-range UniV3 IDRISS/ETH pool, along with the IDRISS tokens reserved for liquidity. This opens the market for trading on Uniswap and DEX aggregators like Jumper.
