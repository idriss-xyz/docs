#### Decentralized Revenue Sharing

Project revenue streams will be distributed through permissionless smart contracts, compensating users and token holders for specific actions they perform. The IDRISS DAO will finalize the details of this decentralized revenue sharing mechanism in Q2 2025.

#### Optimistic Governance

Token holders have voting rights within an Optimistic Governance framework. This model combines startup-like agility with transparency. A core team manages day-to-day operations, while token holders provide decentralized oversight. They trust the team to make routine decisions but retain the power to veto major changes or replace the team if needed. Full community governance launches in early March.
