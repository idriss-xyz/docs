IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT PURCHASE THE TOKENS DESCRIBED HEREIN.&#x20;

Whereas:

1\. The following Terms and Conditions of Token Sale and Use (these “Terms”) form an agreement between IDRISS DAO LLC a company incorporated with limited liability in the Republic of Marshall Island, with registered office in PO Box 852, Long Island Rd, Majuro, Marshall Islands MH 96960 (the “Company” or “We” or “Our” or “Us”) and you, or the entity you represent, (“You” or the “Purchaser” or “Your”) and contain the terms and conditions for the purchase and use of a cryptographic ERC-20 standard token, initially deployed on Ethereum and canonically bridged to the Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base as a native SuperchainERC20 token, named “IDRISS”, with the symbol “IDRISS”, which will have a total maximum supply of 1 billion (the “Tokens” or a “Token”). You and the Company are each a “Party” and, together, the “Parties” to these Terms. This document describes the terms and conditions and is, in fact, the sale contract of the Token as well as set out Your rights as a Token holder.&#x20;

2\. The Company reserves the right to change these Terms, in its sole discretion, at any time without prior notice. Your continued ownership and use of the Tokens after such changes indicates your acceptance of the Terms as modified. It is your responsibility to review the Terms regularly. The Terms were last updated on June 14, 2025.

3\. The Token is generated by a smart contract initially deployed on Ethereum and canonically bridged to the Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Base as a native SuperchainERC20 token (the “Smart Contract”) and duly audited.

4\. The Token is both a governance token as well as a utility token. First, Token holders will have the right to vote in relation to the Company’s decisions, according to the Optimistic framework implemented in the Company (governance). Second, the IDRISS project revenue stream will be distributed via permissionless smart contracts among IDRISS project users and Token holders who perform certain actions as a form of remuneration for their project participation. The details of the decentralized revenue sharing mechanism will be put to vote based on the Optimistic framework at a future date&#x20;

5\. The Tokens can be purchased in DEXes, CEXes, within Token Sale, or can be given for free in specific special events. Please note that the Company website contains a button for purchasing the token which is only a link to a CEX from which you can buy the Token. Please also note that when you buy a token, You don't connect directly with the Token Smart Contract, but only with the smart contract of a DEX or CEX.

6\. Prior to purchasing the Tokens, You should carefully read and be sure to have understood these Terms. If You have any questions regarding these Terms, please contact the Company at [hello@idriss.xyz](mailto:hello@idriss.xyz). If any of these Terms are unacceptable to You or You have some forms of mental reservation, please do not proceed to purchase the Tokens. We also strongly encourage You to consult with a lawyer, CPA, accountant and/or tax advisor before proceeding to purchase the Tokens.&#x20;

7\. The Tokens should be purchased only by individuals or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and functioning of the blockchain, cryptocurrencies and of the cryptographic tokens, especially Ethereum-based tokens. While the Company will always be available to answer to technical questions of the Purchaser of Tokens prior, during or after the purchase of the Tokens, the Company will not be responsible in any way for loss of any cryptocurrency, including Tokens, resulting from actions taken by, or omitted by Purchaser. If You do not have such experience or expertise, then You should not purchase the Tokens.&#x20;

11\. FURTHERMORE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU DIRECTLY SOLICITED THE COMPANY OR THE DEX OR THE CEX TO PURCHASE THESE TOKENS AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY SOLICITATION, WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT, BY THE COMPANY OR ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS OR AFFILIATED ENTITIES FOR PURCHASING THE TOKENS.&#x20;

2\. Rights conferred by the Tokens&#x20;

2.1 The lawful holders of one or more Token have the exclusive rights to participate in an off-chain optimistic governance signaling framework by means of vetoing DAO proposals as they see fit. The exact parameters of the governance framework and the voting system, including, if applicable, voting power proxy, proposal quorum, approval majority, voting power delegation, and proposal execution, are specified in the public project documentation.

2.2 The price of the Token will be determined dynamically and based on the functioning of the liquidity pool, an established system of DeFi. THEREFORE, THIS MEANS THAT YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THAT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FIXED PRICE. In other words, while the initial liquidity pool is designed to support a fixed-price sale at $0.03 per Token, external factors including but not limited to high demand, slippage, or trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may result in Tokens being purchased at prices above or below the intended fixed price.

2.3 The most important factors potentially impacting on the price of the Token will be examined below, where there may be others, equally important, not listed below:&#x20;

* Slippage risk: when You buy a Token You may incur slippage, meaning the price per Token may vary depending on transaction size, liquidity depth, and network conditions. This risk may also apply during interactions with the UniV3 liquidity pool post-sale.
* Liquidity constraints: post-sale, the full-range UniV3 IDRISS/ETH liquidity pool may experience temporary illiquidity or price slippage during periods of high trading demand or market activity.&#x20;
* Market volatility: The Token price may fluctuate significantly due to open market demand, trading activity, or speculative behavior. The Company's post-sale decision to swap USDC proceeds for ETH and provide liquidity on Uniswap may further contribute to short-term price instability.
* Bot Activity: Participation in the Token Sale and subsequent trading on decentralized exchanges may expose You to front-running or bot activity. The Company cannot prevent or mitigate the effects of automated trading bots interacting with the sale or the UniV3 liquidity pool.

2.4 The Company is not responsible for the above listed factors, as well as those not listed above, impacting the price of the Token and by accepting these Terms You specifically accept that the price of the Token may be totally volatile and that you may lose your entire investment.

2.5 As a Token holder, You will have the right to lock your Token/s in the Vault for the time that You wish so as well as You will be able to unlock it at any given time. By locking your Token/s you will have the following benefits:

* Earn 12% APR subsidized by IDRISS DAO Treasury and calculated based on your time-averaged staked balance over the course of the year.
* Tap into the decentralized revenue sharing from IDRISS, with details finalized at a future date.

Additionally if you lock at least 10,000 IDRISS You will have access to premium features.&#x20;

2.6 If You are eligible for the airdrop, as described in the following Article 3, you can opt to claim and lock your Tokens under the two specific following options:

* You can claim 50% of the airdrop tokens and deposit them into the vault without a lockup period, but you forgo the remaining 50% of the airdrop.
* You can claim 100% of the airdrop, but by doing so, you agree to lock them until July 6, 2025, when they will be deposited and unlocked in your vault.

3\. Airdrop

On January 27, the airdrop will be live for those who are eligible based on the rules outlined [here](https://docs.idriss.xyz/idriss-token/retroactive-distribution).

4\. Force Majeure

The Company is not liable for failure to perform caused by unavoidable casualty, delays in delivery of materials, embargoes, government or regulatory orders, acts of civil or military authorities, acts by common carriers, emergency conditions (including weather conditions), acts of terrorism, security issues arising from the technology used, failure of Ethereum or other similar platform, or any similar unforeseen event that renders performance commercially implausible. If an event of force majeure occurs, the party injured by the other’s inability to perform may elect to suspend the terms, in whole or part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances.
