# Vault

The Vault is a mechanism allowing you to lock IDRISS tokens to earn rewards. Tokens can be locked and unlocked at any time, with only gas costs required. Tokens give benefits only while they are locked, with no unbonding period.

* Earn 12% APR on locked tokens (non-compounding, distributed every six months with the first payout on July 6, 2025)
* Lock 10,000 $IDRISS or more to access upcoming premium features
* Tap into decentralized revenue sharing from IDRISS apps (planned for a future date)
