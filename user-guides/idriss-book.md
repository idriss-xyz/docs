## What is IDriss Book?

IDriss Book is a decentralized address book that lets you use a short and familiar identifier like your Twitter name, email, or phone number instead of a wallet address.

## How to Register?

Registration takes less than 60 seconds. Follow this step-by-step registration guide below.
