#### Setting up OBS Studio

Generate an OBS link to display donations as an overlay on your stream by clicking **OBS Link** in the creators app.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is not your donation link. It only works within OBS and serves no purpose outside of it.
{% endhint %}

To create an overlay:

1. Open [**OBS Studio**](https://obsproject.com/)
2. In your active scene, right-click on **Sources** and select **Add**
3. Choose **Browser** from the list
4. In the **URL** field, paste the link you copied from the creators app
5. Set the **Width** and **Height** to match your stream’s resolution (e.g., set to 1920 and 1080 for a 1920x1080 stream)

7. Adjust the positioning of the browser source on-screen as needed
